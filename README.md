# Coral-Colors

This is my theme for repl.it. [@frissyn](https://repl.it/@frissyn)(@frissyn(I don't know if you will get pinged)) created a project called reflux which is a package you can import in repl.it to style your IDE. I have created my own theme called 'DE DOORK BALUE', which is actually supposed to be Coral-Cave or something like that(I am not good at coming up with names). I hope you like it just like [@FlaminHotValdez](https://repl.it/@FlaminHotValdez) did and I hope you use it.

## Recommendations

I would want frissyn(formerly known as IreTheKid) to create some changes to this project, like I would want the theme to work on the 'full' posts and not only on comments and the main part of the post. I think this can be edited a lot but for the time being this is nice enough.

## How to Use

So, to use this you need to create a python repl first on repl.it. You can also install the reflux package online in pip or something but I recommend using repl.it for this. Then you need to go to the packages section and search for reflux, and install it. After that you have to go to the python file and copy the code from here to there. Then run the python file and you will see another file pop up called 'theme.min.js'. You have to copy everything from that and create a bookmark/favorite of the page. Then edit the bookmark/favorite and change the url to all the code you copied from the 'theme.min.js' file. This creates a bookmarklet, which is lots of js code in a bookmark/favorite. It runs this code when you press it. To run the theme you have to press the bookmarklet. You will see nice blue colors which are pleasing to the eyes(I heard many people say that so...). The downside to this is that you have to press the bookmarklet whenever you want the theme to run, it doesn't start automatically. frissyn told me that on the discord server someone had told how to create a tampermonkey extension to keep the bookmarklet running automatically but they(cause I don't know frissyn's gender) doesn't know where it is now. If they find it they will send it to me but for now this is all we have.
